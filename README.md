# Fish Species Prediction

## About the Project

This dataset is a record of 7 common different fish species in fish market sales. With this dataset, a predictive model can be performed using machine friendly data and estimate the weight of fish can be predicted. The weight of the fish based on species name of fish, vertical length, diagonal length, cross length, height, and diagonal width can be found using Random Classifier.
The data is trained using RandomClassifier and the model is saved as pickle file. Also the model is hosted using Heroku and is available on https://fish-species-prediction-new.herokuapp.com/

## Build with 

We used python to implement the projet and available in .ipynb files.
The model is saved as pickle file and available as .pkl

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

We will use the fish species dataset.
Download flasgger to the local machine.

### Models
Random Classifier

### How to use it.
Download the classifier.pkl file for the saved model.
Dowload Flagger API.py file for the flagger code.
